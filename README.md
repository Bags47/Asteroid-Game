# My First Game

This is my first game made using python, taught and guided through via the [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) course.

The base projet was just the moving player and asteroids, the shots produced from the player and basic kill functions.

Since the end of that course I have continued to add to the game trying to improve my skills.
Things Added:
- Screen wrap for all objects.
- A one time use shield.
- A score and highscore.
- Shot sounds.
